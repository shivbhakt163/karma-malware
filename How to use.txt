STEP 1 : if the target machine has python installed then do not install it again, and proceed to STEP 2, other wise install it.
STEP 2 : After installation of python, run the script "ur_karma.py".
STEP 3 : Boom!, machine's cmd will overload due to execution of same task infintely, since this script has the ability to re run itself
	 which results in a never ending loop. And hence, it makes the cmd tasklist overload and excessive resource consumption and high CPU
	 which has the capability to cause potential harm to the machine's operating system.
